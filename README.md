# Vin-Cento's Zsh

## Description
The story of this configuration started back in 2020. Back then I made the conscious decision to switch from GUI applications to TUI/CLI applications. My objective was to craft a ZSH config that would enhance experience of using CLI applications. I identified that a good shell, not talking about a shell for creating scripts, should have autocompletion, autosuggestion, and vim binding.
